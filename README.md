# Is the Escalator Broken?

Is the Escalator Broken? (ITEB for short) tracks user-reported downtime of the escalator in the Cal Poly Pomona Library.  
First solo web-dev project lmao, will be messy and probably take a long time to do but let's see where this goes.

## Stack

Vue.js, Firebase, Vercel

## To-Do

✅ Deploy site  
✅ Home page design:  
\ ☐ Button to report broken escalator  
\ ☐ Button to go to calendar page
☐ Calendar page design:  
\ ☐ Graph reflecting the downtime of the escalator throughout a day  
\ ☐ Heatmap reflecting the downtime of the escalator for each day of the calendar
