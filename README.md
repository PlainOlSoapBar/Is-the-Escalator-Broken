# Is the Escalator Broken?

Is the Escalator Broken? (ITEB for short) tracks user-reported downtime of the escalator in the Cal Poly Pomona Library.  
First solo web-dev project lmao, will be messy and probably take a long time to do but let's see where this goes.

## Stack

## To-Do

✅ 🚀 Deploy site  

✅ 🏠 Home page design:

- ☐ Functionality to view a specific day and generate a graph reflecting the day's downtime of the escalator
- ☐ Color each day of the calendar according to a heatmap reflecting the downtime of the escalator
