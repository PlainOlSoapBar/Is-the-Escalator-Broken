# Is the Escalator Broken?
Is the Escalator Broken? (ITEB for short) tracks user-reported downtime of the escalator in the Cal Poly Pomona Library.  
First solo web-dev project lmao, will be messy and probably take a long time to do but let's see where this goes.

## Stack
Vue.js, TailwindCSS, Firebase, Vercel

## To-Do
✅ Deploy site  
☐ Nav bar  
☐ Home page:  
\ ☐ Button to report broken escalator  
☐ Calendar page:  
\ ☐ Graph reflecting the downtime of the escalator throughout a day  
\ ☐ Heatmap reflecting the downtime of the escalator for each day of the calendar
